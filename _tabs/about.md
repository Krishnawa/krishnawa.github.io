Hello! I’m Krishna, a hardware engineer with a deep love for machines and technology. Outside of work, I’m an off-roader at heart, often riding my XPulse 200 4V and tackling enduro trails almost every week. I also enjoy mountain biking and exploring new routes. Traveling is one of my greatest passions, and I love discovering new places and experiencing different cultures along the way.

This blog is my space to share my personal adventures, thoughts, and the world of electronics, off-roading, and travel. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
