# Introduction

When it's comes to review your electronics project you have to go through many small and big things, here we are going to list out what I'll review in my project. Here I'm divide into to items 

1. Schematic review points
2. Layout review points

## Schematic common review points

- [ ] Check all the sheets Headings

- [ ] In the Title block section check the Author name, Date, Project Name, Page number

- [ ] Check component orientation and it's name and designator

- [ ] Verify all Port names correctly assigned or not

- [ ] Check the readability of schematic

## Schematic Technical review points

- [ ] Verify component size and it's price

- [ ] Unconnected pin and recommendation

- [ ] Check the Application notes

- [ ] Check the power source and it's connector and polarity

- [ ] Check the PCB/Product naming

- [ ] Title block and date & time

- [ ] check the debug/programming connector pin-outs and ref schema

- [ ] check the programmer pin-out

- [ ] Recommended De coupling Caps

- [ ] Check DNIs

- [ ] Check the controller main clock and it's load capacitors are correct

- [ ] MCU current consumption all power domain.

- [ ] Do the power budgeting of all major components and verify the regulator can handle that much current

- [ ] Check the ambient temperature of the circuit were we are using according to that select the components

- [ ] Do Power dissipation and Junction temperature of main components and verify it's not violating the component operating temperature

- [ ] Check the VDD/VCC with datasheet

- [ ] MCU code size

- [ ] Interface Speed

- [ ] current consumption of each block in the MCU

- [ ] Do the Power dissipation and find the junction temperatures of the regulator

- [ ] Critical supply check the accuracy

 

## Layout review points

- [ ] Check the de couping cap placement and vias

- [ ] Check the board stackup

- [ ] check the pre-defined width of traces

- [ ] If it is controlled impedance board check the trace width and the distance between each traces

- [ ] check the dedicated ground plane is breaking or not

- [ ] Avoid Loops in the power traces

- [ ] check the signal rate/frequency and according to plan the layout
