## Story

I started trying to make watch prototypes in 2015. My first watch prototype was a complete copy of the code and hardware I found online. At the time, I was just starting my engineering journey, and it was built using an Arduino Nano.

Four years later, I wanted to create a watch that could fit on a single board. That‚Äôs when I started working on the **BEEWATCH MK1**.

I started this project with a breadboard prototype.

For this project, my inspirations were:
- [Zak's DIY digital wristwatch](https://blog.zakkemble.net/diy-digital-wristwatch/)
- Circuit State's [ISL1208 RTC tutorial](https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/interfacing-intersil-isl1208-rtc-with-arduino/)

I chose the ISL1208 RTC because the article helped me understand how RTCs function. While experimenting with the library, I discovered a bug: the weeks were not updating. I contacted the CEO of Circuit State, Vishnu Mohan, who encouraged me to fix it. At the time, I didn‚Äôt have much confidence in working with libraries‚ÄîI had only created small libraries for my projects. However, I decided to give it a try. If I remember correctly, it took me about a week to find and fix the issue. It was a fantastic learning experience for me.

The BEEWATCH MK1 PCBA was ready after two iterations. However, there was a problem with the OLED display: it would stop working after about a minute. Strange, right? I spent time debugging and realized the issue was related to the charge pump capacitors. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt resolve it at the time. I eventually lost interest and didn‚Äôt have the time to debug further. Still, I hold onto the dream of wearing my own watch, it would make me incredibly proud üòå.

Now, many years later, I‚Äôm planning to create a new watch: **BEEWATCH MK2**. I‚Äôm not sure how many parts this project will have, but I‚Äôm excited to share my journey. Please enjoy my project notes!


## BEEWATCH MK2

This is completely different from MK1, like Iron Man suits ü§ñ. It will be very promising and capable hardware, opening up limitless possibilities. Here are the specs I'm planning to implement in MK2:

Here, we are using the **ESP32-S3**, which has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS‚Äîa deadly combo! ‚ò†Ô∏è

Why? Because this hardware enables us to do a lot more than just tell time. Here are some possible applications:

| **Research and Development**| Test new algorithms (motion analysis, GPS tracking), prototype wearable applications.            |


Even with the ESP32, we can make a tiny hacking device ‚ò†Ô∏è. That‚Äôs why I call it **limitless possibilities**. However, I won‚Äôt implement all these features in the first revision. My first priority is to make a simple timekeeping watch with basic features. Later, I‚Äôll work on the software to achieve some of the applications listed above.
