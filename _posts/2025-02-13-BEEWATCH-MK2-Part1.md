## Story

I started trying to make watch prototypes in 2015. My first watch prototype was a complete copy of the code and hardware I found online. At the time, I was just starting my engineering journey, and it was built using an Arduino Nano.

Four years later, I wanted to create a watch that could fit on a single board. Thatâ€™s when I started working on the **BEEWATCH MK1**.



### BEEWATCH MK1

I started this project with a breadboard prototype.

For this project, my inspirations were:
- [Zak's DIY digital wristwatch](https://blog.zakkemble.net/diy-digital-wristwatch/)
- Circuit State's [ISL1208 RTC tutorial](https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/interfacing-intersil-isl1208-rtc-with-arduino/)

I chose the ISL1208 RTC because the article helped me understand how RTCs function. While experimenting with the library, I discovered a bug: the weeks were not updating. I contacted the CEO of Circuit State, Vishnu Mohan, who encouraged me to fix it. At the time, I didnâ€™t have much confidence in working with librariesâ€”I had only created small libraries for my projects. However, I decided to give it a try. If I remember correctly, it took me about a week to find and fix the issue. It was a fantastic learning experience for me.

The BEEWATCH MK1 PCBA was ready after two iterations. However, there was a problem with the OLED display: it would stop working after about a minute. Strange, right? I spent time debugging and realized the issue was related to the charge pump capacitors. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t resolve it at the time. I eventually lost interest and didnâ€™t have the time to debug further. Still, I hold onto the dream of wearing my own watch, it would make me incredibly proud ðŸ˜Œ.

Now, many years later, Iâ€™m planning to create a new watch: **BEEWATCH MK2**. Iâ€™m not sure how many parts this project will have, but Iâ€™m excited to share my journey. Please enjoy my project notes!


## BEEWATCH MK2

This is completely different from MK1 like iron man suitesðŸ¤–, so it will be  very promising and very capable hardware, by this hardware we  think limitless possibilities
