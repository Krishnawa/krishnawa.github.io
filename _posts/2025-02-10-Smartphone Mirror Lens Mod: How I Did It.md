## Story  

I have a [SHARP Aquos R6](https://jp.sharp/products/aquos-r6/) as a secondary backup smartphone in case of emergencies. I bought it very cheaply from a refurbished online store, it was a great deal for me, and the specs were also really good!  

On December 20, 2024, I was riding my bike to my friend's home. While on the way, I used this phone for navigation. Unfortunately, I met with an accident. I was riding peacefully at a speed of 45-50 km/h when suddenly a Swiggy delivery boy blindly overtook a vehicle very close to me. We collided, and it was a terrible situation.  

Luckily, I was wearing my riding gear, as I always do, which protected me from physical injuries. However, my bike and phone werenâ€™t as fortunateâ€”both were severely damaged. ðŸ˜¢  

After the accident, we went to the hospital for a check-up. A couple of months later, once everything was back to normal, I inspected my broken phone. Fortunately, there were no issues with its functionality. It only had minor scratches on the edges, but the back glass panel was shattered into a million pieces. ðŸ˜¢

## Inspiration

So, I'm very obsessed with smartphone photography. I got a couple of **telephoto lenses, macro lenses, and wide-angle lenses**.  

I also tried to make a **DoF adapter** for my phone **three years ago**, but it didn't go well. I bought all the required components for a **Canon EF mount lens**, but except for the lens, I mistakenly bought a **Canon EF-M mount lens** instead. At that time, I thought both were the same.  

Anyway, I stuck with the project. There were so many challenges, but eventually, I gave up. You know, I tend to procrastinate, and over time, I completely forgot about this project.  

Recently, I saw some videos about the **Xiaomi 12S Ultra Concept**:  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZm4gg5CvWc" 
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

I always wondered when something like this would be available in the market at an affordable price. But now, I think it's time to make one myself at a very low cost.

**So in this project I'm using a Canon 50mm EF-M mount lens for my phone sensor!**

Also, this YouTuber **[ModAndShoot](https://www.youtube.com/@ModAndShoot)** inspired me to take action. I really appreciate his work and want to thank him! ðŸš€

## Technical part you must know!

### About Actual Focal Length:
![Screenshot from PhotoPills](https://i.postimg.cc/502bFjW8/Screenshot-20250211-183827.png){: lqip="https://i.postimg.cc/502bFjW8/Screenshot-20250211-183827.png" }
_Screenshot from PhotoPills_
- The **actual focal length** of the **Sharp Aquos R6** is **6.8 mm**, which refers to the **physical distance** between the lens and the sensor when focused at infinity.
- **Actual focal length** is important for determining the **field of view**. A **6.8 mm lens** captures a **wider scene** compared to longer focal lengths.
- In smartphones with **smaller sensors**, the **field of view** may seem similar to that of a **longer lens** on a **full-frame** camera, which is why the **19mm (35mm equivalent)** is often mentioned.
- While **6.8 mm** is the **real focal length**, the **equivalent focal length** on a larger sensor is **19mm**, providing an idea of how the lens compares to those on traditional cameras.


### Flange Distance Explained
![FFD](https://i.postimg.cc/qvW13Ffw/Flange-back-back-focal-distance-1014x487.jpg){: lqip="https://i.postimg.cc/qvW13Ffw/Flange-back-back-focal-distance-1014x487.jpg"}
_FFD Representation_

The **flange focal distance (FFD)**, also called **flange-to-film distance**, is the distance between the **mounting flange** of the camera lens mount and the **image sensor plane**. It's a crucial measurement to ensure lenses focus correctly on the camera's sensor.

#### Why Flange Distance Matters:
1. **Lens Compatibility** â€“ The **FFD** determines if a lens can be adapted to a camera body.  
   - Lenses with **longer FFDs** can be adapted to cameras with **shorter FFDs** using simple mechanical adapters.
  
2. **Precision** â€“ Even small errors in the **FFD** can cause significant focus issues, which is why cameras are carefully calibrated to ensure accurate FFD.

3. **Film vs. Digital** â€“  
   - In **film cameras**, the **FFD** is measured to the **film plane**.
   - In **digital cameras**, itâ€™s measured to the **image sensor plane**.
   - This difference is key when adapting lenses across systems.

### Zoom Factor Calculation for a 1-Inch Sensor
![Zoom factor](https://i.postimg.cc/G3TLv1PW/1200px-Full-frame-vs-APS-C-svg.png){: lqip="https://i.postimg.cc/G3TLv1PW/1200px-Full-frame-vs-APS-C-svg.png"}
_image courtesy:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_equivalent_focal_length_


When switching from a **6.8mm focal length lens** to a **50mm focal length lens** on a **1-inch sensor** with a **4:3 aspect ratio**, the zoom factor can be calculated as follows:



#### **Step 1: Understand the Crop Factor**
The **1-inch sensor** has a crop factor of approximately **2.7x**. This means the effective focal length of any lens mounted on this sensor will be multiplied by 2.7 to get its **35mm equivalent focal length**.



#### **Step 2: Calculate the 35mm Equivalent Focal Lengths**

1. **For the 6.8mm lens**:
   - The 35mm equivalent focal length is already given as **19mm**.
   - This is calculated as:

     $$
     \begin{equation}
       \text{35mm Equivalent Focal Length} = \text{Actual Focal Length} \times \text{Crop Factor}
       \label{eq:35mm_equiv}
     \end{equation}
     $$
     $$
     \begin{equation}
       19\, \text{mm} = 6.8\, \text{mm} \times 2.7
       \label{eq:6.8mm_calc}
     \end{equation}
     $$

2. **For the 50mm lens**:
   - The 35mm equivalent focal length is:

     $$
     \begin{equation}
       \text{35mm Equivalent Focal Length} = 50\, \text{mm} \times 2.7 = 135\, \text{mm}
       \label{eq:50mm_calc}
     \end{equation}
     $$



#### **Step 3: Calculate the Zoom Factor**
The **zoom factor** is the ratio of the new focal length (50mm) to the original focal length (6.8mm). This tells you how much "closer" the subject will appear when using the 50mm lens compared to the 6.8mm lens.

$$
\begin{equation}
  \text{Zoom Factor} = \frac{\text{New Focal Length}}{\text{Original Focal Length}}
  \label{eq:zoom_factor}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
  \text{Zoom Factor} = \frac{50\, \text{mm}}{6.8\, \text{mm}} \approx 7.35
  \label{eq:zoom_calc}
\end{equation}
$$



#### **Step 4: Interpretation**
- A zoom factor of **7.35x** means that the 50mm lens will make the subject appear **7.35 times closer** compared to the 6.8mm lens.
- In terms of **35mm equivalent focal lengths**, the field of view changes from **19mm (wide-angle)** to **135mm (telephoto)**.


#### **Summary**
- **Original Lens**: 6.8mm (19mm equivalent)
- **New Lens**: 50mm (135mm equivalent)
- **Zoom Factor**: 
  $$
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{50}{6.8} \approx 7.35x
    \label{eq:zoom_summary}
  \end{equation}
  $$

This means the 50mm lens provides approximately **7.35x zoom** compared to the 6.8mm lens on a 1-inch sensor.

#### **Visualization**
- **6.8mm Lens**: Wide-angle view, suitable for landscapes or group shots.
- **50mm Lens**: Telephoto view, ideal for portraits or isolating distant subjects.
