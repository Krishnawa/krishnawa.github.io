# Story  

I have a [SHARP Aquos R6](https://jp.sharp/products/aquos-r6/) as a secondary backup smartphone in case of emergencies. I bought it very cheaply from a refurbished online store, it was a great deal for me, and the specs were also really good!  

On **December 20, 2024**, I was riding my bike to my friend's home. While on the way, I used this phone for navigation. Unfortunately, I met with an accident. I was riding peacefully at a speed of **45-50 km/h** when suddenly a Swiggy delivery boy blindly overtook a vehicle very close to me. We collided, and it was a terrible situation.  

Luckily, I was wearing my riding gear, as I always do, which protected me from physical injuries. However, my **bike and phone werenâ€™t as fortunateâ€”both were severely damaged.** ðŸ˜¢  

After the accident, we went to the hospital for a check-up. A couple of months later, once everything was back to normal, I inspected my broken phone. **Fortunately, there were no issues with its functionality.** It only had minor scratches on the edges, but the back glass panel was shattered into a million pieces. ðŸ˜¢
