## Story  

I have a [SHARP Aquos R6](https://jp.sharp/products/aquos-r6/) as a secondary backup smartphone in case of emergencies. I bought it very cheaply from a refurbished online store, it was a great deal for me, and the specs were also really good!  

On December 20, 2024, I was riding my bike to my friend's home. While on the way, I used this phone for navigation. Unfortunately, I met with an accident. I was riding peacefully at a speed of 45-50 km/h when suddenly a Swiggy delivery boy blindly overtook a vehicle very close to me. We collided, and it was a terrible situation.  

Luckily, I was wearing my riding gear, as I always do, which protected me from physical injuries. However, my bike and phone weren‚Äôt as fortunate‚Äîboth were severely damaged. üò¢  

After the accident, we went to the hospital for a check-up. A couple of months later, once everything was back to normal, I inspected my broken phone. Fortunately, there were no issues with its functionality. It only had minor scratches on the edges, but the back glass panel was shattered into a million pieces. üò¢

## Inspiration

So, I'm very obsessed with smartphone photography. I got a couple of **telephoto lenses, macro lenses, and wide-angle lenses**.  

I also tried to make a **DoF adapter** for my phone **three years ago**, but it didn't go well. I bought all the required components for a **Canon EF mount lens**, but except for the lens, I mistakenly bought a **Canon EF-M mount lens** instead. At that time, I thought both were the same.  

Anyway, I stuck with the project. There were so many challenges, but eventually, I gave up. You know, I tend to procrastinate, and over time, I completely forgot about this project.  

Recently, I saw some videos about the **Xiaomi 12S Ultra Concept**:  

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZm4gg5CvWc"

I always wondered when something like this would be available in the market at an affordable price. But now, I think it's time to make one myself at a very low cost.

**So in this project I'm using a Canon 50mm EF-M mount lens for my phone sensor!**

Also, this YouTuber **[ModAndShoot](https://www.youtube.com/@ModAndShoot)** inspired me to take action. I really appreciate his work and want to thank him! üöÄ

## Technical part you must know!

### About Actual Focal Length:
![Screenshot from PhotoPills](https://i.postimg.cc/502bFjW8/Screenshot-20250211-183827.png){: lqip="https://i.postimg.cc/502bFjW8/Screenshot-20250211-183827.png" }
_Screenshot from PhotoPills_
- The **actual focal length** of the **Sharp Aquos R6** is **6.8 mm**, which refers to the **physical distance** between the lens and the sensor when focused at infinity.
- **Actual focal length** is important for determining the **field of view**. A **6.8 mm lens** captures a **wider scene** compared to longer focal lengths.
- In smartphones with **smaller sensors**, the **field of view** may seem similar to that of a **longer lens** on a **full-frame** camera, which is why the **19mm (35mm equivalent)** is often mentioned.
- While **6.8 mm** is the **real focal length**, the **equivalent focal length** on a larger sensor is **19mm**, providing an idea of how the lens compares to those on traditional cameras.


### Flange Distance Explained
![FFD](https://i.postimg.cc/qvW13Ffw/Flange-back-back-focal-distance-1014x487.jpg){: lqip="https://i.postimg.cc/qvW13Ffw/Flange-back-back-focal-distance-1014x487.jpg"}
_FFD Representation_

The **flange focal distance (FFD)**, also called **flange-to-film distance**, is the distance between the **mounting flange** of the camera lens mount and the **image sensor plane**. It's a crucial measurement to ensure lenses focus correctly on the camera's sensor.

#### Why Flange Distance Matters:
1. **Lens Compatibility** ‚Äì The **FFD** determines if a lens can be adapted to a camera body.  
   - Lenses with **longer FFDs** can be adapted to cameras with **shorter FFDs** using simple mechanical adapters.
  
2. **Precision** ‚Äì Even small errors in the **FFD** can cause significant focus issues, which is why cameras are carefully calibrated to ensure accurate FFD.

3. **Film vs. Digital** ‚Äì  
   - In **film cameras**, the **FFD** is measured to the **film plane**.
   - In **digital cameras**, it‚Äôs measured to the **image sensor plane**.
   - This difference is key when adapting lenses across systems.
