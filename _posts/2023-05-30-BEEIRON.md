## Story
In the past few years, I had been using a Solderon 25W/230V soldering iron for all my soldering work. However, I decided to upgrade to a temperature-controlled soldering iron. While searching for a good temperature-controlled soldering iron, I had the idea of making one myself.

I began browsing the internet and came across the JBC brand, which had a nice selection of soldering irons. Eventually, I purchased a JBC handle that is compatible with JBC T245 cartridges.

It turned out that the process was not as easy as I initially thought. I encountered numerous challenges along the way, especially considering that this particular version, v0.0.4, is still in beta and not ready for production. In this blog, I will outline the challenges I faced, the mistakes I made, and discuss the issues with the previous version as well as the present one. Additionally, I will address the changes that need to be made in the next revision.

## 1. Features and specification 
- Using [T245](https://www.jbctools.com/t245-a-general-purpose-handle-product-45.html) General Purpose Handle.

_Power path of BEEIRON_
I have a setup with a toroidal transformer that has two secondary windings. One winding provides a 12-0-12V output, which I use for my board supply. To convert the AC voltage to DC, I've used a bridge rectifier and filter capacitor.

In order to power my MCU and peripherals at different levels, I've incorporated Low Dropout Regulators (LDOs). The first LDO generates a 3.3V output specifically for the Thermocouple to Digital converter IC (MAX31856) and the level shifter circuit. The second LDO produces a 5V output, which primarily powers the MCU and other peripherals on the board.

Additionally, I have another winding with a 24-0-24V output. I utilize only the 24-0V portion to supply power to the heating element of the JBC T245 Cartridge.

Overall, this setup provides the necessary voltage levels for each component, ensuring efficient operation.

_Block diagram of BEEIRON_

The diagram is quite straightforward and has a simple design. Let's begin by discussing the user interface section. The I2C-based OLED display is used to show both the set temperature and the real-time temperature. It provides a clear and easy-to-read interface.

For temperature adjustment, we have a minimalistic setup using a Potentiometer (POT). It allows precise control over the set temperature and real-time temperature adjustments.

The pushbutton, accompanied by an LED, serves the purpose of confirming the set temperature. The LED acts as an indicator for the real-time iron supply voltage.

Moving on to the power electronics section! Here, a 24VAC power supply is utilized to operate the heating element. A TRIAC-based switch is placed between the supply and heating element to regulate the voltage and achieve the desired temperature.

To maintain the tip temperature, a thermocouple is employed as a closed-loop feedback system. Additionally, a hall effect-based current sensor is used to measure the current drawn by the heating element, although it was not implemented in this setup. It is an optional feature that could be considered for future improvements.

You might be wondering about the purpose of the optocoupler. Well, here's the answer. The 24VAC supply is also connected to a bridge rectifier, which converts the AC cycle into a rippled DC waveform. The optocoupler's LED is triggered when the rippled DC voltage exceeds the LED's dropout voltage. When the LED is illuminated, the optocoupler's transistor conducts, resulting in a LOW voltage (0V) at the controller side. Conversely, when the DC ripple voltage drops below the LED's dropout voltage, the LED turns off, causing the optocoupler transistor to stop conducting. This action produces a HIGH voltage (5V) pulse with the assistance of a pull-up resistor at the controller side. This pulse serves as an interrupt signal.

Using this interrupt signal and a specific code logic, I devised the following procedure:
- The TRIAC turns on once the set temperature is confirmed.
- After counting 6 interrupt signals, the TRIAC's conduction is halted on the 7th interrupt signal.
- The temperature is measured, and the interrupt counter is reset to 0.
- If the temperature hasn't reached the set temperature, the above process repeats.
- Once the temperature is reached or surpassed, the TRIAC turns off and the interrupt counter resets. The procedure then restarts from the second step.

We really don't need a optocoupler based TRIAC ON/OFF system.
why we are using this system is to 
- avoid phase cutting
- Zero cross phase cutting to reduce the humming noise
- Avoid RFI
- Avoid Humming noise

That covers all the details of the block diagram.

_Internal structure of JBC T245 Tip_
 
Just a heads up, this diagram illustrates the internal structure of a typical JBC T245 Tip. I'm amazed by how they manufactured this tip; it's truly an engineering marvel. Essentially, it consists of two metal tubes. The inner tube is called the **Common (C3)**, while the next layer is covered with an insulator, and the outer layer is the second tube, known as the **Heater (C2)**. At the top of the tip, there's a spiral heater configuration, as depicted in the picture.

What's intriguing is the placement of the thermocouple. Rather than providing separate pins for the heating element and the thermocouple, they combined one of the thermocouple pins with the heating element pin into a single pin. To make it easier to understand, I've included a schematic configuration of the tip. Hopefully, combining these pins is a simple task during manufacturing. As you can see from the picture, the **Thermocouple (C1)** is also a part of the **Common (C3)**. The thermocouple is formed by the intersection of both metals. I believe they used a different metal fused at the intersection of these metals to create the thermocouple. It's quite fascinating, isn't it?

If you'd like to learn more about thermocouples, you can click [here](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/thermocouple.html).

Additionally, from my investigation, I've determined that it's an N-type thermocouple, if I'm not mistaken. To test the thermocouple, I used boiling water as a reference temperature (100°C) and measured the voltage across it. I obtained a reading of approximately 2.7mV. I used my **Mini Hotplate MHP30** to measure various temperatures and recorded the voltage readings. Although I can't guarantee the accuracy of my data, I have confidence in my findings. Based on the data, I concluded that the thermocouple is likely N-type. I cross-checked my readings using a thermocouple chart.

#### Why Toroidal Transformer?
- Compact Size: Toroidal transformers are more compact and lighter than conventional transformers with the same power rating. The toroidal shape allows for efficient use of space, making them ideal for applications where size and weight are critical factors.

- High Efficiency: Toroidal transformers are known for their high efficiency. The toroidal core design minimizes magnetic flux leakage and provides a more direct magnetic path, resulting in lower losses and improved overall efficiency.

- Low Electromagnetic Interference (EMI): Toroidal transformers produce less electromagnetic interference compared to laminated transformers. The toroidal core design reduces the magnetic field radiation and minimizes EMI, making them suitable for use in sensitive electronic devices.

- Reduced Mechanical Hum: Toroidal transformers produce less audible noise or mechanical hum compared to traditional transformers. The tightly wound toroidal core design reduces vibrations and eliminates the buzzing sound often associated with laminated transformers.

- Better Voltage Regulation: The circular design of the toroidal core allows for a more uniform distribution of the windings, resulting in better voltage regulation. Toroidal transformers can provide stable output voltage even under varying load conditions.

- Higher Power Density: Due to their compact size and efficient design, toroidal transformers can achieve higher power densities. This makes them suitable for applications where space is limited, such as in audio equipment, medical devices, or power supplies.

- Improved Thermal Performance: The toroidal shape provides a larger surface area for heat dissipation compared to traditional transformers. This allows for better cooling and thermal management, ensuring the transformer operates within acceptable temperature limits.

- Easier Mounting: Toroidal transformers often have a center hole, which facilitates easy mounting and installation. The central hole allows for secure and convenient mounting using screws or bolts, simplifying the integration process.

### 3.9 TRIAC and TRIAC coupler
I used the combo of BTB26-600 as the TRIAC and the MOC3020M as the TRIAC coupler. In this setup, the MCU controls the TRIAC coupler, which then triggers the TRIAC. By using a coupler, we provide isolation to the circuit, which is a good practice. TRIACs and DIACs are fascinating devices, and they could be a topic for another blog!

The MOC301XM and MOC302XM series are optically isolated TRIAC driver devices. They consist of a GaAs infrared emitting diode and a light-activated silicon bilateral switch that acts like a TRIAC. These devices are specifically designed for interfacing electronic controls with power TRIACs to control resistive and inductive loads in 115 VAC operations. It's important to note that this TRIAC coupler is a random phase trigger, rather than a zero-cross phase trigger.

### Power supply
### Bridge Rectifier
![Bridge](/assets/img/BEEIRON/SCH3_Bridge.png){: lqip="/assets/img/BEEIRON/SCH3_Bridge.png"}

maximum and minimum voltage for a 12V AC power supply with a tolerance of +/-10%.

Maximum voltage:
12V + 10% = 12V + (0.10 * 12V) = 12V + 1.2V = 13.2V

Minimum voltage:
12V - 10% = 12V - (0.10 * 12V) = 12V - 1.2V = 10.8V

Now, let's calculate the output voltage of a bridge rectifier using the maximum voltage of 13.2V. A bridge rectifier converts AC voltage to DC voltage with voltage drops of two diodes.

Voltage drop of a diode = ~0.7V
Then, for 2 diodes its 2 x 0.7V = 1.4V

The output voltage of the bridge rectifier = 13.2V - 1.4V = 11.8V

### Finding the ripple voltage of a 1000uF capacitor

Cap equation:

$$ i = {C} {dv\over dt} $$


If the current is constant, and Δv
 is Vripple:

$$ I = C{Δv \over Δt} $$

For a full-wave rectifier(2 x f):

$$ Δt = {1 \over 2f} $$

Combining equations and solving:

$$ I = C{Δv2f} $$

Then we can find the equation for Δv,

$$ Δv = {I \over C2f} $$


Where:
Δv is the ripple voltage,
I is the load current,
f is the frequency of the AC input, and
C is the capacitance.

Let's assume a load current of 0.5A, a frequency of 50Hz, and a capacitance of 1000μF (0.001F). Using these values, we can calculate the ripple voltage.

Vripple = (0.5A) / (2 * 50Hz * 0.001F) ≈ 4.16V

Therefore, the ripple voltage in the rectifier circuit with a 1000μF capacitor, assuming a load current of 0.5A and a 50Hz AC input, is approximately 4.16V.
