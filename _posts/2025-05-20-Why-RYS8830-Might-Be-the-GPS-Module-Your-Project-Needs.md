## Introduction

I'm working on a GNSS-based watch to get accurate time ‚åö, so I needed a tiny GNSS module that's both affordable and easy to use. Luckily, I found the **RYS8830** from [Reyax](https://reyax.com), a Chinese company that designs and manufactures GNSS modules, along with LoRa, Bluetooth, and cellular (4G/LTE) modules for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

The RYS8830 is available locally for me, which is a big plus. It's incredibly small, just **11 √ó 11 √ó 2.2 mm**  and has very low current consumption (idle current: **3.7 mA**, sleep current: **0.26 mA**), making it a perfect fit for my project. So I thought this module might be a good fit for your future project too.

### Key Features of the RYS8830 

- **Small SMD form factor (11 x 11 mm)**
- **Ultra low power consumption**
- **Enhanced GNSS filter and low noise amplifier (LNA)**
- **Embedded antenna** for simplified integration
- **Powered by SONY CXD5605AGF Engine**

These features make it ideal for compact, battery-powered projects like wearables and IoT sensors.

Personally, working with GNSS feels like dealing with alien technology üëΩ. Once you understand the magic behind it, it genuinely gives you goosebumps!

Just think about it: you're getting the **exact time from your GNSS receiver** by decoding the data from multiple GNSS satellites üõ∞Ô∏è flying over **20,000 km++** above the Earth üåç. Mind-blowing, right?

Maybe I'll write a blog about GNSS sometime in the future. Stay tuned!


## What This Blog Covers

In this blog, I'm introducing the tiny GPS module **RYS8830**, and with a development board  showing how we can communicate with it to gather useful information like:

- **Basic understanding of GNSS**
- **NMEA-0183 GNSS Message structure**
- **Time**
- **Date**
- **Position**
- **Speed**
- **Altitude**

Let‚Äôs explore how to bring precise satellite timing to your next DIY project!

## Basic Understanding of GNSS

If you think the GNSS module in your device (like your smartphone) gets location data by **sending a request to a satellite** and the satellite then **replies with your location**, you're actually mistaken.

Think about it ‚Äî there are around **6.9 billion smartphones** in the world, plus many more GNSS-enabled devices in **vehicles, drones, aviation, maritime, farming**, and other applications totaling over **1.5 billion** additional devices. If each device were actively sending requests to satellites and waiting for a reply, imagine how many satellites and how much processing power that would require!

It's okay to think this way at first, but let's break down how it really works.

---

A **GNSS system** typically has **24 to 30+ satellites** orbiting Earth at around **20,000 km altitude**. These satellites are **constantly broadcasting radio signals** that include:
- Their current **position**
- The **exact time**, from highly precise **atomic clocks**

Your device like a smartphone or a GNSS module is a **passive receiver**. It **picks up these signals** from multiple satellites and **measures the time delay** between when the signal was sent and when it was received.

Using this delay, the receiver calculates the **distance** to each satellite. Then, it uses [**Trilateration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration) to determine its exact position on Earth.

To calculate your position in 3D space (latitude, longitude, altitude), you need a **minimum of 3 satellites**. But there's a catch:  
Your device's clock is **not synchronized** with the atomic clocks in the satellites. Even a **microsecond** (1 ¬µs) of timing error can cause a **300 km error** in calculated position.

To fix this, your receiver needs a **4th satellite** to solve for the **time offset**, so in practice, **you need at least 4 satellites** for an accurate location fix.

I'm not diving into too much detail here, but if you're curious, I recommend watching this [**YouTube video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPTIi7Ds15M) for a better visual explanation.

You might notice that I often say ‚Äú**GPS**‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGNSS.‚Äù Why?

That‚Äôs because **GPS** was the **first GNSS**, built by the **United States**. It stands for **Global Positioning System**. It was initially developed for **military use**, and was opened to the public in the **1980s**, after a tragic incident in 1983 where a **civilian airliner (KAL 007)** was shot down due to navigation errors. Since then, GPS has become the **most widely used** term, even though today we have multiple GNSS systems like **GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou,** and **NavIC**.

So, I use the word ‚ÄúGPS‚Äù simply because it‚Äôs more familiar and widely recognized, even though ‚ÄúGNSS‚Äù is the correct general term.

I hope this short overview helps you understand the **basic working of GNSS** and clears up common misconceptions!

## NMEA-0183 GNSS Message structure



fun fact
10.23MHz

The first consumer GPS receiver (1981, "Magellan NAV 1000") weighed 16 kg (35 lbs) and cost $100,000+! Today, a $10 chip in your phone does the same job.
